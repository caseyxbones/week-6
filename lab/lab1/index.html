        Monday—Friday. The city is divided into 67 regions, each of which is
        assigned to one of the five days of the week.</p>
        <p>This application shows each region color coded based on day of
        week of garbage collection. To get more information about garbage
        collection for one of the regions, click on that region on the map.</p>
