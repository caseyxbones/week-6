/* ================================
Week 6 Assignment: Slide Model
================================ */

/** Here's a simple 'model' of a slide.
 *  It tracks the slide's index and the title we want in our HTML
 */
var slideExample = {
  slideNumber: 1,
  title: "My first slide"
};

// I spoke to Nathan and he said that rather than doing a slide model I can create a dynamic map using crime incident data
// The code for that (so far) is in the midtermFunctions.js document
